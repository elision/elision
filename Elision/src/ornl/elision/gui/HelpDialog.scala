README
======
This is the rewrite tree visualization GUI for the Elision term rewriter. This short file
describes how to use the GUI.

Visit the Elision web site at:
http://stacyprowell.com/wiki/doku.php?id=elision


Menu options
======
The File menu contains the following items:

* Open : Opens an open file dialog to open a file containing Elision term data. When the file 
	is opened, it is immediately processed by the REPL as input and a visualization tree is 
	constructed for the entire file. 

* Quit : Exits the application.

The View menu contains the following items:

* Reset camera : Resets the camera's position and zoom to its original state.

* Set decompression depth : Opens a dialog for the user to specify the depth out to which nodes 
	in the tree visualization are decompressed.

The Help menu contains the following items:

* Help : Opens this helpful help dialog.

* About : Opens a dialog containing product information about the Elision Visualization Assistant


GUI controls
======
Panning the camera : 
	Clicking and dragging the mouse anywhere in the visualization area will allow the user to 
	move the camera's position.
	
Zooming the camera :
	Scrolling up with your mouse's scroll wheel will cause the camera to zoom in towards the mouse. 
	Similarly, scrolling down with your mouse's scroll wheel will cause the camera to zoom away 
	from the mouse.

Selecting a term node :
	Clicking on a term node in the tree visualization will highlight that node and cause the tree to 
	become decompressed out to the current decompression depth relative to that node. That term node's
	properties will be displayed in the Atom Properties area.
