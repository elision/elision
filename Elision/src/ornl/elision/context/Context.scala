  // Serialization
  //======================================================================
  
  /* How Serialization Works
   * =======================
   * Serialization is complicated by the fact that some operators depends on
   * other operators in their definition.  It is also the case that an operator
   * named X might depend on another operator named X, captured as a closure.
   * Likewise some operators and other objects depend on rulesets, and those
   * have to be declared appropriately.  Finally, the order of rule declaration
   * is significant.
   * 
   * Serialization of a context works as follows.
   * (1) Serialize the rules in the order they were declared.  Whenever an
   *     operator or ruleset is encountered, emit its declaration right there,
   *     and also emit anything it depends on.
   * (2) Emit any ruleset declarations not already visited.
   * (3) Emit any operators not already visited, first emitting any operators
   *     and rulesets they depend on.
   * (4) Emit the bindings.
   * 
   * If we are creating Scala code, then we have to handle native operators.
   * To make that simpler, we use a trick to avoid compilation of the native
   * operators.  The trick is to emit the native handler code so it is
   * installed at operator creation, which is allowed by a protected method.
   */
