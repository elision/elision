/**
 * Represent a variable.
 * 
 * == Structure and Syntax ==
 * A variable is indicated with a leading dollar sign (`$`) followed by a
 * valid symbol.  So the following are valid variables:
 * - `$``x`
 * - `$``Fred51_2`
 * - <code>$`1`</code>
 * 
 * == Guards ==
 * A variable is allowed to have a guard.  The guard is substituted before the
 * variable is bound, and must evaluate to `true` to allow the binding to take
 * place.
 * 
 * == Type ==
 * Every variable must have a type, and the type can be `ANY`.
 * 
 * == Equality and Matching ==
 * Variables are equal iff their name, type, guard, and labels are all equal.
 * 
 * Variables can be bound, so that gets checked during matching.  A variable
 * pattern matches a subject iff it is already bound to that subject, or if it
 * is unbound and the types match.  Guards are not matched; this would be
 * problematic, as the guards are used to determine whether a match succeeds!
 * Labels are also not matched, as they serve a different semantic purpose.
 * 
 * @param typ			The variable type.
 * @param name		The variable name.
 * @param guard		The variable's guard.
 * @param labels	Labels for this variable.
