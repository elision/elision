/**
 * The common root for all application atoms.  This class represents the
 * "applicative dot."
 * 
 * == Purpose ==
 * An ''apply'' takes two atoms and applies the first (as an operator,
 * rewriter, etc.) to the second (as the argument).
 * 
 * In general this just forms a pair, but certain left-hand sides will
 * undergo specialized processing by the system.
 * 
 * == Use ==
 * Use this class via the companion object, so that the correct result is
 * returned.  The result may be any kind of atom.
 * 
 * @param op		The left-hand element of the apply (operator).
 * @param arg		The right-hand element of the apply (argument).
