/**
 * The root of all atoms manipulated by the rewriter.
 *
 * To use this, extend the class as a new `case class`.  Then implement the
 * abstract methods and fields, and override any methods or fields you need to.
 * 
 * The following list is a short guide to some of the things you should do when
 * you implement `BasicAtom`.
 * 
 *  - Specify the type of the object.  To do this add `val theType = `(a basic
 *    atom).
 *    
 *  - Implement `tryMatchWithoutTypes`.  You can safely assume this method is
 *    not invoked until ''after'' the types have been matched successfully.  You
 *    can also assume this may be invoked multiple times if there are many
 *    potential matches for the types.
 *    
 *  - Implement `rewrite`.
 *  
 *  - Implement `toParseString`.  This must return a string that is parseable by
 *    [[ornl.elision.core.AtomParser]] to re-create the atom.
 *    
 *  - If necessary, override `toString`.  This must return a string that is
 *    parseable by Scala to re-create the atom.  In many cases making the class
 *    into a `case class` will be sufficient, but if there are arguments that
 *    are primitive types, such as strings, whose toString method does not
 *    produce a parseable result, this must be adjusted.  Be sure to see the
 *    implicitly added `mkParseString` method found in the package object
 *    [[ornl.elision.core.package]], as this can help.
 *    
 *  - Write code to specify the De Bruijn index of the instance and add
 *    `val deBruijnIndex =` to set the index.  This can be computed as follows.
 *    - Instances with no children have De Bruijn index of zero.
 *    - Instances other than lambdas with children have index equal to the
 *      maximum index of their children.
 *    - Lambdas have index one greater than the index of their body, and the
 *      body must also be rewritten to replace the variable with a De Bruijn
 *      index variable.  The implementation of this is left to classes that
 *      implement lambdas.
 *    {{{
 *    // Common implementation with children.
 *    val deBruijnIndex = children.foldLeft(0)(_ max _.deBruijnIndex)
 *    }}}
 *      
 *  - Write code to compute the depth of the instance.  This can be computed
 *    as follows.
 *    - Instances that do not have children have depth of zero.
 *    - Instances with other atoms as children have depth equal to the maximum
 *      depth of their children, plus one.
 *    {{{
 *    // Common implementation with children.
 *    val depth = children.foldLeft(0)(_ max _.depth) + 1
 *    }}}
 *      
 *  - Write code to determine if the instance is a constant.  A constant can be
 *    arbitrarily complex, but cannot contain variables.  This can be computed
 *    as follows.
 *    - Variables are not constants.
 *    - Literals are constants.
 *    - Instances with children are constant iff all their children are
 *      constant.
 *    {{{
 *    // Common implementation with children.
 *    val isConstant = children.forall(_.isConstant)
 *    }}}
 *    
 *  - Write code to compute the `constantPool`.  This is somewhat complex;
 *    see the documentation for the field for how to do this without going
 *    insane.
 *    
 *  - Specify whether this atom represents a term, or a metaterm.  If a term,
 *    then set `isTerm` to `true`.  Otherwise, set it to `false`.
