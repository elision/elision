/**
 * Bindings are used to store variable / value maps used during matching, and
 * as the result of a successful match.
 * 
 * == Purpose ==
 * The bindings class is a proxy to Scala's `HashMap`.  This is not possible
 * to implement correctly (so far as I can tell) using the current (2.9)
 * collection proxy classes, because the type decoration is lost when
 * invoking methods that return a map.
 * 
 * This is not an atom!  If an atom to hold the bindings is needed, then
 * an instance of [[ornl.elision.core.BindingsAtom]] is created.  This is
 * typically done implicitly by Elision at the point it is needed, since
 * object creation is costly.
 * 
 * == Use ==
 * See the companion object for methods to create bindings, or for the
 * singleton object representing empty bindings.  Since bindings are
 * immutable(ish), it is wasteful to repeatedly create empty bindings!
 * 
 * Yes, bindings are actually slightly mutable.  There is a matching cache
 * accessible via `set`.  Beware!
 * 
 * @param self	The backing map.
