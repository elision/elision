/** 
 * Provide implementations of specific forms of matching.
 * 
 * There are several basic matching algorithms.
 * 
 *  - [[ornl.elision.core.matcher.SequenceMatcher]] handles non-associative,
 *    non-commutative matching.
 *  - [[ornl.elision.core.matcher.CMatcher]] handles commutative,
 *    non-associative matching.
 *  - [[ornl.elision.core.matcher.AMatcher]] handles associative,
 *    non-commutative matching.
 *  - [[ornl.elision.core.matcher.ACMatcher]] handles associative, commutative
 *    matching.
 * 
 * There are also supporting classes that handle parts of the matching process.
