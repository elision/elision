  /* How associative matching works.
   * 
   * There must be at least as many subjects as patterns.  If there is an
   * equal number, then we use the sequence matcher to perform the match.
   * Otherwise we need to group the items to perform the match.
   * 
   * Because we cannot re-order the atoms, we need a completely different
   * form of matching for associativity.
   * 
   * Naive associative matching works as follows.  If we have P patterns and
   * S subjects (S>P) then we need to break the S subjects up into P groups.
   * We can do this by inserting P-1 "markers" between subjects, and we can
   * do this in (S-1) C (P-1) ways.
   * 
   * If a marker comes between items n and n+1, we say the marker is after
   * position n.  We then have an array of P-1 markers, initialized to hold
   * 0, 1, 2, ..., P-2.  That is, position i initially holds the value i.
   * 
   * We advance to the next position by incrementing the highest position
   * marker (position P-2).  If that exceeds the limit for that marker, then
   * we increment the prior marker, and reset the current marker to the first
   * legal position.  We continue in this fashion until the array holds the
   * stop position, , ..., S-2
   * 
   * We can illustrate this below for four patterns, and seven markers.
   * 
   * subjects (markers are |)        array
