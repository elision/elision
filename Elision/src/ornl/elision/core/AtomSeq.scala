 * commutative, associative, idempotent, and may have absorbers and identities.
 * These properties have an effect on the list when it is constructed.  For
 * example, a list that is associative, commutative, and idempotent is
 * essentially a set.  If not idempotent, it is a multiset.  Properties are
 * specified with an algebraic properties object.
 *
 * == Use ==

 * atoms to include in the list.  The atoms are specified using an instance
 * of an `IndexedSeq`.
 *
 * @param props		The properties for this atom sequence.
