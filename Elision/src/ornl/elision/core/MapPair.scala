 * Provide an ordered pair that also serves as a very simple kind of rewrite
 * rule.
 * 
 * == Purpose ==
 * The map pair can use used to construct a pair, but when applied on the
 * left hand side of the applicative dot, it tries to match the right-hand
 * side against its left-hand side.  If the match succeeds, the result is
 * the rewrite of the map pair's right-hand side and a true flag.
 * 
 * At present there is no way to specify general guards, so the first match
 * of the left hand side is used immediately and unconditionally.  (Variable
 * guards are, of course, honored.)
