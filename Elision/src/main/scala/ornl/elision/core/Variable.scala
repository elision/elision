/**
 * Represent a variable.
 * 
 * == Structure and Syntax ==
 * A variable is indicated with a leading dollar sign (`$`) followed by a
 * valid symbol.  So the following are valid variables:
 * - `$``x`
 * - `$``Fred51_2`
 * - <code>$`1`</code>
 * 
 * It is also possible to construct a "by name" variable.  This is a variable
 * that has an implicit guard (in addition to any other guards it may have)
 * that restricts the variable to only matching itself.  That is, the by-name
 * variable FOO matches only the variable FOO, and not anything else.  This
 * is denoted by enclosing the variable name in quotation marks.
 * - `$``"``FOO``"`
 * By-name variables otherwise behave as synonyms for the variable itself, so
 * if you directly bind `$``"FOO"` to 17, you have actually bound `$``FOO`
 * to 17.
 * 
 * == Guards ==
 * A variable is allowed to have a guard.  The guard is substituted before the
 * variable is bound, and must evaluate to `true` to allow the binding to take
 * place.
 * 
 * In fact, the variable "guard" is more.  The guard is specified as an atom
 * in curly braces after the variable name and before any type information.
 * For proposed binding of variable `$``x` to value `v`, with guard `g`, we do
 * the following.
 * 
 * - If `g` is a [[ornl.elision.core.Rewritable]], then `g.a` is computed and
 *   if the flag is true, `$``x` is bound to the resulting atom.
 * - If `g` is a [[ornl.elision.core.Applicable]], then `g.a` is computed and
 *   `$``x` is bound the result.
 * - Otherwise `g` is assumed to be a predicate, and is rewritten with the
 *   potential bindings.  If the result is true, then `$``x` is bound to `v`.
 * 
 * In all other cases the binding attempt is rejected.
 * 
 * See the previous section for information on the implicit guard created for
 * a "by name" variable.
 * 
 * == Type ==
 * Every variable must have a type, and the type can be `ANY`.
 * 
 * == Equality and Matching ==
 * Variables are equal iff their name, type, guard, and labels are all equal.
 * 
 * Variables can be bound, so that gets checked during matching.  A variable
 * pattern matches a subject iff it is already bound to that subject, or if it
 * is unbound and the types match.  Guards are not matched; this would be
 * problematic, as the guards are used to determine whether a match succeeds!
 * Labels are also not matched, as they serve a different semantic purpose.
 * 
 * @param typ			The variable type.
 * @param name		The variable name.
 * @param guard		The variable's guard.  Default is true.
 * @param labels	Labels for this variable.  Default is none.
 * @param byName  If true, this is a "by name" variable.  Default is false.
