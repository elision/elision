   * This class operates as follows.
   * 
   * An instance is passed a subordinate iterator, perhaps from a child atom,
   * and a closure that performs whatever additional work is necessary to
   * generate a full match.
   * 
   * The next match is generated by first getting the next match from the
   * subordinate iterator, obtaining a binding.  Then the local match closure
   * is invoked to generate a match outcome.  There are three possibilities.
   * 
   * (1) The complete match fails.  In this case the next subordinate match
   *     is obtained from the iterator, until it is exhausted.
   *     
   * (2) There is a single match.  In this case the binding is stored as the
   *     current binding and will be returned by next.
   *     
   * (3) Many matches are obtained.  In this case the resulting match
   *     iterator is stored in the localiter field.  The next match is
   *     obtained and stored as the current binding, and will be returned
   *     by next.
   *     
   * Essentially matching runs in this manner until a binding is successfully
   * obtained - or the subordinate iterator is exhausted.
   * 
   * Generating the next match is the job of getNextMatch, which is responsible
   * for returning a binding.  If no binding can be generated, then null is
   * returned to indicate exhaustion.
   * 
   * The exhausted flag indicates whether this iterator is exhausted.  Setting
   * and checking this flag is the responsibility of the hasNext method; no
   * other methods reference it.
   * 
   * If current is set to a binding, then the next method will return it.  If
   * current is set to null, then the next method invokes hasNext, whose job
   * it is to figure out if there is a next match.  To do that, hasNext
   * invokes getNextMatch, if necessary.
